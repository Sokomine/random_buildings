This is work in progress and not yet finished.

WARNING: random_buildings:build looks like a chest and "spawns" a building. It does NOT yet check if the area is free! Don't use in your main world.

The mod 'cottages' is ready for usage.
'random_buildings' and 'mobf_trader' are in development stage. If you want to run this modpack on a server, delete these two subfolders for now!

The texture cottages/textures/cottages_slate.png is derived from Universal schema.jpg by Stefanie Lindener, which can be found here: http://de.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Datei:Universal_schema.jpg&filetimestamp=20060510110309& The texture is CC-by-sa 2.0/de.
